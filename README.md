## Project task

:warning: **If you are using AD Blocker**: Turn off the AD Blocker for a full experience!
This project is focused on tracking IP addresses and displaying their location on the map. Maps are powered by React Leaflet.

## Project overview

This react app wants to know your location. If you allow it, we will find your location on React Leaflet map. Your IP address, location, timezone, and IPS will also be displayed. If you browse someone else's IP address, their info will show up. I used React Leaflet, Ipify AIP, and context as an app provider.
